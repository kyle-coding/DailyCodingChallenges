# DailyCodingChallenges
(Nearly) daily programming challenges to help develop my skills as a programmer


This repo is intended to help me with the following goals:
a) Develop my skills as a programmer
b) Create a portfolio of work to show future employers my skills

Although I am calling this my "DailyCodingChallenges", I don't think I can keep up with this literally every day. However, I do intend to keep up with this repo as I learn more skills from online Python classes. Hopefully in a few months' time, this will serve as a catalog of my journey from a beginner to advanced Python programmer.
